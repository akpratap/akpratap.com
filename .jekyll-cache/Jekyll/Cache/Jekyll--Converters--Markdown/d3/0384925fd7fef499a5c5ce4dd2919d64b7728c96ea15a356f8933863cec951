I"à<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>We wanted to build a feature in ASP.Net Core using which we could serve remote files (stored in database/blob storage) to clients via simple URLs.
E.g.
https://your-application.com/library/folder
https://your-application.com/library/folder/file-name.pdf
Â 
ASP.NET Core abstracts file system access through the use of File Providers, and it uses Static File MiddlewareÂ to locate static files. Static files, such as HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript, are assets in an ASP.NET Core app and can be served directly to clients.
Â 
Solution:
Build a custom IFileProvider for ASP.NET Core which can allow remotely located files (database/Azure Blob/AWS S3) to be treated as if they were an integral part of the application, and allow them to be part of the static file functionality
